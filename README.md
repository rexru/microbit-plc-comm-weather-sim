# microbit-plc-comm-weather-sim
This project demonstrates serial communication between a Micro:bit and an Industrial Shields PLC as part of an Endress+Hauser weather simulation cart. The Micro:bit is used as a low-cost, educational microcontroller to interface with industrial-grade PLC hardware, enabling data exchange and control.
